Ruby To UML creates a UML class diagram from Ruby source code.

![][uml_diagram_demo]

## Installation

    gem install ruby_to_uml

## How to use

1. Go to your Ruby project directory

2. Run ruby_to_uml
    * To create diagram for a whole project: `ruby_to_uml lib/`
    * To create diagram for one file: `ruby_to_uml lib/thing.rb`
    * Pass in the '-s' or '--smart' option for ruby_to_uml to decuce associations between classes
    * Pass in the '-l' or '--link' option to output link to diagram instead of saving png

3. Open uml.png

**Important, Ruby to UML doesn't work with large programs like Pry (9K LOC). It can work with Minitest (5K LOC)**
Unfortunately, that is due to a limitation with the diagram generating service (yUML) and cannot be fixed.

## Features

* Guess the types of the instance variables (smart mode)
* Inheritance
* Associations (see "How to add associations to a diagram")
* Mthods and instance variables

## How it works

Ruby to UML uses `ruby_parser` to parse Ruby source code to an S-expression tree. Then, the S-expression is parsed into UML classes. Finally, the UML classes are convert to a DSL and sent to [yUML](http://yuml.me/)'s API for conversion into a diagram.

## On dynamic languages

Ruby's extreme decoupling and duck-typing philosophy doesn't judge a class by its hierarchy.
Thus, variables don't have a predefined type, which conflicts with uml's static typed object-model.
The objective of this project isn't to bend uml's model to make it semantically comply with
duck typing (by the use of interfaces, or other tricks), but to add a basic visual representation
of the code of your project for documenting and helping maintainers.

## How to add associations to a diagram

Because of the above point, there's no direct way to automatically draw associations between your
classes. However, if you want an association to be shown on your diagram simply annotate your classes such as:

    # type of @weapon: Rainbow
    class Unicorn

      def initialize weapon
        @weapon = weapon
      end
    end

## Smart mode

If you use ruby_to_uml with the `-s` or `--smart` option, it'll try to guess
the types of the associations based on the name of the instance
variables.

If you class variable is @duck, then it will try to create an
association with the "Duck" class, if it exists.

If your variable is @ducks, it will try to create an association with a
cardinality of '*' with a class called "Duck", if such a class exists.

## Release Notes

[Have a look at our CHANGELOG][changelog] to get the details of all changes between versions.

### Versioning

We follow [SemVer][semver] convention for versionning.

That means our releases use the following format:

```
<major>.<minor>.<patch>
```

- Breaking changes bump `<major>` (and reset `<minor>` & `<patch>`)
- Backward compatible changes bump `<minor>` (and reset `<patch>`)
- Bug fixes bump `<patch>`

## Contributing

Development of Ruby To UML has stopped, since the use of yUML limits the use cases of this tool to smaller applications.
An entirely different program that controls the diagram rendering is necessary to overcome this limitation.

<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:END -->

This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification. Contributions of any kind welcome!

## Why fork Umlify?

This gem is a fork of [umlify](https://github.com/mikaa123/umlify).
That project is no longer maintained, but the code is good and solves a problem.
Ruby To UML fixes breaking issues with Umlify and adds new features.

Thank you to previous contributors for creating Umlify and to Michael Sokol for allowing us to republish it!
