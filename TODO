Features to add
===============
* Add recurcive parse
  - You can give a directory and it will parse the class diagram for all
    the ruby file in the directory.

* Support modules (yUML doesn't seem to support Packages yet)
  - Create a png file for each module?

* Make classes in the html file clickable, so that it links to
  the corresponding RDoc file

* Add annotation - need to define how, and what -

* How about an export to XMI? I think that sounds good.

* Add a way to show dependencies between two classes
